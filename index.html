      You will see ten words moving on the screen, each following its own linear trajectory.
      Your goal is to type words that are currently on the screen, hitting space or enter between different words.
      As soon as a word hits the border of the screen or you type a word correctly, it disappears from the screen and is replaced by another word at a randomly chosen position.
      Once you type a word correctly, the number of letters in that word is added to your score.
      The moment you hit a keyboard key, a 60-second timer will start counting down.
